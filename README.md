### Hi there I'm Shikhar ðŸ‘‹

I am an pursuing Engineering student, I love to play outdoor games like Basketball, Soccer, and I am also good at athletics, and also I am a very big fan of the DC Comics and Movies. Other times you can also find me learning new skills, solving some real world and competetive programming problems. My love for programming began in my 12th standard when I was introduced to C++ (ofc adding two numbers) and I have never stopped discovering new facts about programming since. Right now I am focusing on learning some basics of Data Science and ML but I also have some knowledge about Data Structures and OOPs.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some basic projects.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning DS and ML using Python. 

- âš¡ Fun fact about me: You can ask me any Batman related facts and I would know the answer 101 out of 100 times.
