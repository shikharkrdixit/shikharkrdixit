**Hello, there visitor, My name is Shikhar** 👋


***

I am an Engineering student in the Information Technology department, I love to play outdoor games like Basketball, Soccer, and I am a good athlete too, I was awarded as the allrounder championship in Sports, also I am a very big fan of the DC Comics. Other than these you can find me learning new skills, solving real world and some Programming Problems. My love for programming launched in my 12th standard when I was introduced to C++ (ofc with adding two numbers) and I have never stopped discovering new stuff about programming since.
